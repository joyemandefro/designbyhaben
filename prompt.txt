Step 1
Create a basic HTML project with the following files:
- index.html
- style.css
Include Tailwind CSS via CDN in the index.html file. 
Set up a standard HTML5 boilerplate with a `<head>`, and `<body>`. 
In the body, include a <div id="app"> where I can build the site.

Step 2
Inside the <div id="app">, add a navigation bar at the top with the following:
- A logo on the left that says "Haben's Decor"
- Navigation links on the right: Home, Services, Gallery, Contact
Make it fixed to the top and responsive using Tailwind CSS.
 Add a light background and soft shadow.


Step 3
Below the navigation, add a full-screen hero section with:
- A background image (use a placeholder from Unsplash)
- A centered large heading: "Transforming Moments into Memories"
- A subheading: "Elegant decor for weddings, events, and celebrations"
- A button: "View Our Work"
Use Tailwind CSS to center all content and make it responsive.


Step 4
Add an 'About Us' section with:
- A heading: "About Us"
- A short paragraph about the business:
 "We specialize in elegant and timeless wedding and event decorations, 
 helping clients create unforgettable moments with beautiful and customized decor."
- A soft background color
Center the text and add padding for spacing.


Step 5
Create a 'Services' section with:
- A heading: "Our Services"
- Three cards, each with an icon, title, and short description:
  1. Wedding Arches — "Elegant floral and fabric wedding arches"
  2. Table Decor — "Customized centerpieces and table settings"
  3. Backdrops & Lighting — "Photo-worthy backdrops with ambient lighting"
Make the layout responsive using Tailwind's grid system.
Use background images (use placeholder images from Unsplash)


Step 6
Add a 'Gallery' section with:
- A heading: "Our Work"
- A responsive grid of 6 images using Tailwind CSS
 (use placeholder images from Unsplash)
Ensure the layout adjusts for mobile and desktop screens.


Step 7
Create a testimonials section with:
- A heading: "What Our Clients Say"
- Three quote boxes with client names and short testimonials
Style them with soft background colors, drop shadows, and rounded corners.


Step 8
Add a contact section with:
- A heading: "Contact Us"
- A form with fields: Name, Email, Message
- A submit button
Use Tailwind to style the form with padding, rounded inputs, and a background section.


Step 9
Add a footer with:
- The text: "© 2025 Haben's Decor. All rights reserved."
- Social media icons (you can use placeholders or simple text links 
like Instagram, Facebook)
Style it with a dark background and white text. Center the content.


Step 10
Ensure the entire website is responsive and mobile-friendly using Tailwind CSS classes.
 Add spacing and flex/grid adjustments where needed so it looks good on phones
and tablets.


Step 11
Improve the overall design by:
- Using a consistent font across the site (e.g., add Google Font 
like 'Inter' or 'Poppins')
- Adding subtle animations on hover for buttons
- Smoothing section transitions
- Using soft shadows and rounded corners for a modern look
Use Tailwind CSS.
